## My process


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS display & position
- Attempting without Flexbox or Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to deploy with GitHub Pages to show my solution or ask for help in Frontend Mentor. I've deployed beforehand with Siteground, Heroku, and Google App Engine and this method was the easiest by far.

I learned a quirky aspect of old CSS. Apparently for inline-block elements, if the property is given to 2 different divs and it doesn't align next to each other, it's due to an HTML file problem. In HTML, the 1st closing div tag and the 2nd open  div tag must be next to each other in 1 line. Basically deleting the white space (enter) between them. Who knew?

I attempted to complete some steps based on the knowledge I know. Once I was satisfied, I would then watch a bit of his process to understand his thinking and see if there was a better approach.


### Continued development

At the moment I have completed the desktop version of this challenge. I will continue to work on the mobile version without the guidance of the YouTube video. Next challenge will include CSS flexbox & grid which I am very excited about. It was difficult without it.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This game all the properties and its shorthands that come with Flexbox. I would recommend this for visual learners who want to learn through a fun and interactive game.

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I often refer to this documentation about Flexbox. It contains good illustrations that helped me understand the purposes of different properties, especially with the parent-child relationship.
