### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I often refer to this documentation about Flexbox. It contains good illustrations that helped me understand the purposes of different properties, especially with the parent-child relationship.

- [A Complete Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Same platform as flexbox that I will be referring to for Grid guidance.
