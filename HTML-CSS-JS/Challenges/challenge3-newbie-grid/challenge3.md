## Overview

### The challenge

[Single price grid component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc) is a challenge that helps users practice Responsive Design for desktop & mobile versions.

Users should be able to:

## My process


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS display & position
- Attempting without Flexbox or Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to deploy with GitHub Pages to show my solution or ask for help in Frontend Mentor. I've deployed beforehand with Siteground, Heroku, and Google App Engine and this method was the easiest by far.

I learned a quirky aspect of old CSS. Apparently for inline-block elements, if the property is given to 2 different divs and it doesn't align next to each other, it's due to an HTML file problem. In HTML, the 1st closing div tag and the 2nd open  div tag must be next to each other in 1 line. Basically deleting the white space (enter) between them. Who knew?

I attempted to complete some steps based on the knowledge I know. Once I was satisfied, I would then watch a bit of his process to understand his thinking and see if there was a better approach.


### Continued development

I have completed the desktop & mobile versions of this challenge. I did complete most of the challenge with the guidance of the video. I wanted to see what the approach and thinking was from someone who is already experienced. I hope to take the same approaches as he did to attempt a challenge in Frontend Mentor. Next challenge will include CSS flexbox & grid which I am very excited about. It was difficult without it.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Diner Game](https://flukeout.github.io/) - This game helped me understand all different levels of selectors. I would recommend this for anyone starting to learn them, but yet to grasp from just plain reading.
