# JavaScript Generator

Replicated a "HTML + JavaScript Generator Challenge" page from YT Video without guidance from the video

The only thing I did adopt from [Zach's github](https://github.com/zachgoll/fullstack-roadmap-series/blob/main/code-challenges/lesson-7/solution/script.js) was the library of memes, jokes, quotes & riddles for data to display.

Challenge: I had a hard time figuring out how to efficiently create an Accordion effect. I looked at Zach's github for inspiration and the code was a lot shorter than what I had in mind with removeChild(), so I took that approach instead.
